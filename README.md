**Difference Between `switch case` and `if else` in C++**
`switch case` is used when you want to compare a single variable against multiple constant values (commonly of type `int` or `char`). It makes the code cleaner and more efficient for clear, fixed options.
On the other hand, `if else` is more flexible because it can handle complex logical conditions, compare between variables, and use relational operators like `<`, `>`, and `==`.

**Quick tip:**

* Use `switch case` for simple menu or option selection.
* Use `if else` for more complex or multi-condition logic.
